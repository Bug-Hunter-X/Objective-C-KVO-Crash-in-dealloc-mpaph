This bug arises when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  Imagine you have an object, 'MyObject', with a property 'myValue'. You add an observer to 'myValue' and then remove the observer in `dealloc`. However, if `dealloc` is called while the observer is still in the process of receiving a KVO notification, a crash may occur. This happens because the observer might attempt to access memory that has already been freed.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myValue;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    if ([keyPath isEqual: @"myValue"]) {
        // ... process the change ...
    }
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myValue"];
}
```
